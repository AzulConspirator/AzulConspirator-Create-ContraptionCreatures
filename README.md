    - Locomotive Worker : Trade Train Centric Stuff

- Custom Mobs
    - Gatherers : Driller & Cutter Automatons

## Acknowledgement

my goal for this is to use the same execution but not the same designs.

this mod is basically a Fabric Alternative to;
- [scorched bronze : haywire robots,bandits and guns](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/haywire-robots-bandits-and-guns-a-scorched-bronze)
- [Create: Dynamic Village](https://github.com/aesefficio/DynamicVillageMod/tree/1.19.2)

its kinda odd that this kind of mod doesnt already exist for the fabric loader whilst the forge versions are being utilized in most modpacks. thus why i made this.

### What the difference?

- Profession Workstations are custom blocks
- Profession Outfits are custom
- Trades are the same (for now, il adjust as needed)
- Mob designs & functionalities was remade

## Planned

- ~~Custom Village Structures (for better immersion)~~ Scrapped for now, got no good solution

- More Create based Enemies

- alternative Create-based gun (think less Crayfish, more potato cannon)

## QnA

- update to latest version?
  - if Create Fabric is prominent there, then yes
- why the slow updates?
  - time constraints mainly.
- why does it seem incomplete?
  - because it is. im building it up as i go along on learning how to do modding.
