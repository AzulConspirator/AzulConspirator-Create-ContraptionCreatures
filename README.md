## QnA
- **can you update this to the latest version?**
  - if Create Fabric is prominent there, then il eventually do it
- **why does the loot drop seems to easy?**
  - its intended for people like myself who dont like going on long mining sessions just for the basic stuff. mobs are there just to balance it out. but balacing it more wont hurt.
- **Can i use this for my Modpack?**
  - Sure why not, just give a headsup. very curious what combos this mod has with others.
- **May I suggest something?**
  - Please do, just head to the [Discussion Section](https://github.com/AzulConspirator/AzulConspirator-Create-ContraptionCreatures/discussions)


## Acknowledgement
### wait this looks like..
yes...this mod is basically a Fabric Alternative to;
- [scorched bronze : haywire robots,bandits and guns](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/haywire-robots-bandits-and-guns-a-scorched-bronze)
- [Create: Dynamic Village](https://github.com/aesefficio/DynamicVillageMod/tree/1.19.2)

my goal for this mod is to use the same execution but not the same designs.

its kinda odd that this kind of mod doesnt already exist for the fabric loader whilst the forge versions are being utilized in most modpacks. thus why i made this.

### What the difference?
- Profession Workstations are custom blocks
- Profession Outfits are custom
- Trades are the same (for now, il adjust as needed)
- Mob concepts arent original, but highly rework in visual design and function
- Guns are uniquely design to be functionally different from one another
