            - Knight : Warden Killer
            - Dummy : Damage Sponge
```

## Planned

- More Create based Enemies

- alternative Create-based gun (think less Crayfish, more potato cannon)

## QnA

- update to latest version?
  - if Create Fabric is prominent there, then yes
- why the slow updates?
  - time constraints mainly.
- why does it seem incomplete?
  - because it is. im building it up as i go along on learning how to do modding.


## Acknowledgement

### wait this looks like..
yes.. , this mod is basically a Fabric Alternative to;
- [scorched bronze : haywire robots,bandits and guns](https://legacy.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/haywire-robots-bandits-and-guns-a-scorched-bronze)
- [Create: Dynamic Village](https://github.com/aesefficio/DynamicVillageMod/tree/1.19.2)


my goal for this mod is to use the same execution but not the same designs.

its kinda odd that this kind of mod doesnt already exist for the fabric loader whilst the forge versions are being utilized in most modpacks. thus why i made this.

### What the difference?

- Profession Workstations are custom blocks
- Profession Outfits are custom
- Trades are the same (for now, il adjust as needed)
- Mob concepts arent original, but highly rework in visual design and function
